# About

This package is free software distributed under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/sebastienheyd/boilerplate/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Why this package ?

My name is Sebastien, I'm a web developer since 1998 (professionally since 2006).

In my current job, I'm often asked to create applications from scratch.

Rather than using solutions that didn't suit me (full installation of a Laravel project for example), I decided to
create my own package.

With time, other packages will be grafted on top of it to add features more quickly.

I hope you will like this project and be satisfied with it.
